So first writeup I've done, I'm doing this while I set it up. I've done a few others, but I am quite a noob when it comes to this kind of thing so it's all good to learn and
I can write all my notes here for the meantime. I've done the Mr Robot and about 3/4 others on HTB (I stopped as I had alot of issues with connection and just general bugs)

So start off with an arp scan, and trying to remember which one the box is as we have way too many IOT devices. Followed by the classic -sV -sC scan on nmap.

So after some network fiddling to get them to work as I'm an idiot, we are left with this
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
| http-cookie-flags: 
|   /: 
|     PHPSESSID: 
|_      httponly flag not set
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Login
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel


So, I'll have a look at the HTTP page and find a straight login page. After looking at the page source we find

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Login</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <style>
        body{ font: 14px sans-serif; }
        .wrapper{ width: 360px; padding: 20px; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <h2>Login</h2>
        <p>Please fill in your credentials to login.</p>

        
        <form action="/index.php" method="post">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label>Username</label>
                <input type="text" name="username" class="form-control " value="">
                <span class="invalid-feedback"></span>
            </div>    
            <div class="form-group">
                <label>Password</label>
                <input type="password" name="password" class="form-control ">
                <span class="invalid-feedback"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Login">
            </div>
            <p>Don't have an account? <a href="register.php">Sign up now</a>.</p>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


So possible to maybe change response with burpsuite or something?

anyway continue to check stuff out, while I quickly look at metasploit search to see if any of those things I can use as a vunerability.
